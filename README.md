# The Seequa Chameleon

![chameleon](./kicad/reference_images/chameleon_front_03.jpg)


The Chameleon was an interesting PC clone luggable. 

It had a Z80 and 8088 CPU, which could be switched between, allowing a Chameleon owner to use both MS-DOS and CP/M.

Forgoing the usual ISA expansion slots, it included a number of peripherals directly on the motherboard, including an integrated CGA-compatible video card with some interesting additions such as font SRAM and palette registers.

This project aims to produce schematics for the Chameleon by tracing out the motherboard in Kicad.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to Matthew Jones for nerd-sniping me with this fascinating and wonky machine.
